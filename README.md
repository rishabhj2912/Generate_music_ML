## Generating music with Machine Learning

### Objective


`The objective of our project is to generate music using machine learning models. Some known models which can be applied to generate music are vanilla neural network, an LSTM RNN, and an encoder-decoder model.`

### Motivation

` To test how successful the music generation is from the neural networks, we will evaluate the prediction of the next note against the actual next note as a percentage score.`

### Datasets 

`MIDI Ô¨Åles of some piano music composers are used as dataset.`

` Some composer used are :-`

1. Chaplin 
2. Burg
3. Elise
4. Schubert
5. Pathetique
6. Mond
7. Waldstein

### Result
`In conclusion, among the algorithms that we tried, the wavenet model performed the best.`
